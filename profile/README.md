## 🧬 What's kiimesoft

Kiimesoft is an open source organization created by [@dubisdev](https://github.com/dubisdev) to host and maintain a bunch of apps.

All kiimesoft apps:

- 🤝 **Are Free Open Source Software (FOSS)**: anyone can use them freely.
- 🔏 **Keep user data private**: they don't track you or your data.
- 🪟 **Support Windows**: the main OS where they are developed.
- 🛠️ **Are built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)**: which makes them small and fast.
